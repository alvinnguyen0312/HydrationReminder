# Hydration Reminder - Android App
## Inspiration:
This native Android app is created to help users drink more water because people sometimes forget keeping their body hydrated during the day.
## What it does
- Set up user's profile with recommended daily water consumption
- Track water amount user drink during the day with visual chart
- Track history record of previous consumption periods (charts)
- Allow users to set up notification/ interval to remind them to drink water
