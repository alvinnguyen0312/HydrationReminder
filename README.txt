Description: This water drinking app will remind user to drink water and keep track of their water comsumption
Requirement:
1. The app GUI use different types of GUI control: button, toggle button, edittext field, switch button.
2. It has 3 activities: Setting (user can set up their profile - these info will be saved on a file named User_profile.txt), 
Home(user track their water drinking) and History (user can see their recorded data has been 
visualized).
3. In the Home activity,user click Drink whenever user drinks water to record the amount of water. The app will show the needed water amount based on user's setting. 
There is a progress bar that shows the amount of water remaining for user to drink. Each time user clicks Drink,
the record will be reflected on Progress Bar and that data will be written to a file txt named "History".
4. The ability to load or remove previous record/ all records: my app will allow users to undo their previous
drink action (button Undo), or reset to default drinking progress (button Reset) or delete all drinking record (button
Delete History in History activity)
5. The data has been visualized in History activity. Ideally it will show the consuming amount of everyday recorded.
I litteraly show data by using bar charts, however, I still need to work more on the data part to show them correctly.
6. Button Setting allows user to set up their profile, About button that allows user to see name and author of the application.
It also allows to set up a frequency reminder. They can set an interval so that the app will send a reminder to them 
to drink water.The app will store all setting value when user open the app next time
